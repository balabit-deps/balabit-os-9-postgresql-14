      Tighten security checks in planner estimation functions
      (Dean Rasheed)
      <a class="ulink" href="https://postgr.es/c/afe38fb6a" target="_top">§</a>
     </p><p>
      The fix for CVE-2017-7484, plus followup fixes, intended to prevent
      leaky functions from being applied to statistics data for columns
      that the calling user does not have permission to read.  Two gaps in
      that protection have been found.  One gap applies to partitioning
      and inheritance hierarchies where RLS policies on the tables should
      restrict access to statistics data, but did not.
     </p><p>
      The other gap applies to cases where the query accesses a table via
      a view, and the view owner has permissions to read the underlying
      table but the calling user does not have permissions on the view.
      The view owner's permissions satisfied the security checks, and the
      leaky function would get applied to the underlying table's
      statistics before we check the calling user's permissions on the
      view.  This has been fixed by making security checks on views occur
      at the start of planning.  That might cause permissions failures to
      occur earlier than before.

      Prevent <span class="application">pg_dump</span> scripts from being used

      Since dump/restore operations typically involve running SQL commands
      as superuser, the target database installation must trust the source
      server.  However, it does not follow that the operating system user
      who executes <span class="application">psql</span> to perform the restore
      should have to trust the source server.  The risk here is that an
      attacker who has gained superuser-level control over the source
      server might be able to cause it to emit text that would be
      interpreted as <span class="application">psql</span> meta-commands.
      That would provide shell-level access to the restoring user's own
      account, independently of access to the target database.
     </p><p>
      To provide a positive guarantee that this can't happen,
      extend <span class="application">psql</span> with
      a <code class="command">\restrict</code> command that prevents execution of
      further meta-commands, and teach <span class="application">pg_dump</span>
      to issue that before any data coming from the source server.

      The results were sometimes wrong on 64-bit platforms, and wildly
      wrong on 32-bit platforms.  This did not produce obvious failures
      because the logic is only used to choose how to merge values into
      ranges; at worst the index would become inefficient and bloated.
      Nonetheless it's recommended to reindex any BRIN indexes that use
      the <code class="literal">numeric_minmax_multi_ops</code> operator class.

      Our workaround for a bug in early 2.13.x releases

     </p><p>
      We do not allow partitions or inheritance child tables to have
      row-level triggers with transition tables, because an operation on
      the whole inheritance tree would need to maintain a separate
      transition table for each such child table.  But that problem does
      not apply for statement-level triggers, because only the parent's
      statement-level triggers will be fired.  The code that checks
      whether an existing table can become a partition or inheritance
      child nonetheless rejected both kinds of trigger.

      We do not support triggers with transition tables on foreign tables.
      However, the case of a partition or inheritance child that is a
      foreign table was overlooked.  If the parent has such a trigger,
      incorrect transition tuples were collected from the foreign child.
      Instead throw an error, reporting that the case is not supported.

      When choosing an auto-generated name for an index, avoid conflicting
      with not-yet-committed <code class="structname">pg_class</code> rows as
      well as fully-valid ones.  This avoids possibly choosing the same
      name as some concurrent <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> did,
      when that command is still in process of filling its index, or is
      done but is part of a not-yet-committed transaction.  There's still
      a window for trouble, but it's only as long as the time needed to
      validate a new index's parameters and insert
      its <code class="structname">pg_class</code> row.

     </p><p>
      The code that translates <code class="literal">SIMILAR TO</code> pattern
      matching expressions to POSIX-style regular expressions did not
      consider that square brackets can be nested.  For example, in a
      pattern like <code class="literal">[[:alpha:]%_]</code>, the code treated
      the <code class="literal">%</code> and <code class="literal">_</code> characters as
      metacharacters when they should be literals.

      With very large <code class="varname">shared_buffers</code> settings, it was

     </p><p>
      If the server crashes after writing the first part of a WAL record
      that would span multiple pages, subsequent logical decoding of the

      The previous quoting rule was locale-sensitive, which could lead to
      portability problems when transferring <code class="type">aclitem</code> values

      do that, but other tools might.)  To ensure consistency, always quote

     </p><p>
      Our previous round of minor releases included a bug fix to ensure
      that replication receiver processes would respond to cross-process
      cache invalidation messages, preventing them from using stale
      catalog data while performing replication updates.  However, the fix
      unintentionally made them also redistribute those messages again,
      leading to an exponential increase in the number of invalidation
      messages, which would often end in a memory allocation failure.

      Avoid premature removal of old WAL during checkpoints (Vitaly Davydov)
      <a class="ulink" href="https://postgr.es/c/e2832bd96" target="_top">§</a>
     </p><p>
      If a replication slot's restart point is advanced while a checkpoint
      is in progress, no-longer-needed WAL segments could get removed too
      soon, leading to recovery failure if the database crashes
      immediately afterwards.  Fix by keeping them for one additional

     </p><p>
      In some cases a replication client could acknowledge an LSN that's
      past what it has stored persistently, and then perhaps send an older
      LSN after a restart.  We consider this not-a-bug so long as the
      client did not have anything it needed to do for the WAL between the
      two points.  However, we should not re-send that WAL for fear of
      data duplication, so make sure we always believe the latest
      confirmed LSN for a given slot.

     </p><p>
      Creation of a replication slot on a standby server may require waiting
      for some active transaction(s) to finish on the primary and then be
      replayed on the standby.  Since that could be an indefinite wait,
      it's desirable to allow the operation to be cancelled, but there was

      PL/pgSQL's notion of an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">expression</span>”</span> is very broad,

      Ensure stable sort ordering in <span class="application">pg_dump</span>

      <span class="application">pg_dump</span> sorts objects by their logical
      names before performing dependency-driven reordering.  This sort did
      not account for the full unique key identifying certain object types
      such as rules and constraints, and thus it could produce dissimilar
      sort orders for logically-identical databases.  That made it
      difficult to compare databases by
      diff'ing <span class="application">pg_dump</span> output, so improve the
      logic to ensure stable sort ordering in all cases.

      In the rare scenario where we hit out-of-memory while inserting the

      A common reason for using these options is to allow a user-built

      <span class="application">configure</span> failed to detect these
