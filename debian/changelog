postgresql-14 (14.10-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy-security; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (LP: #2040469).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

    + However, several mistakes have been discovered that could lead to
      certain types of indexes yielding wrong search results or being
      unnecessarily inefficient.  It is advisable to REINDEX
      potentially-affected indexes after installing this update.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.9, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Fix handling of unknown-type arguments in DISTINCT "any" aggregate
      functions (Tom Lane)

      This error led to a text-type value being interpreted as an unknown-type
      value (that is, a zero-terminated string) at runtime. This could result
      in disclosure of server memory following the text value.
      (CVE-2023-5868)

    + Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions
      (Tom Lane)

      When assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the
      current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in edge
      cases. Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for arbitrary code
      execution are possible, and so is disclosure of server memory.
      (CVE-2023-5869)

    + Prevent the <literal>pg_signal_backend</literal> role from
      signalling background workers and autovacuum processes (Noah Misch,
      Jelte Fennema-Nio)

      The documentation says that pg_signal_backend cannot issue signals to
      superuser-owned processes. It was able to signal these background
      processes, though, because they advertise a role OID of zero. Treat that
      as indicating superuser ownership. The security implications of
      cancelling one of these process types are fairly small so far as the
      core code goes (we'll just start another one), but extensions might add
      background workers that are more vulnerable.

      Also ensure that the is_superuser parameter is set correctly in such
      processes. No specific security consequences are known for that
      oversight, but it might be significant for some extensions.
      (CVE-2023-5870)

    + Fix misbehavior during recursive page split in GiST index build
      (Heikki Linnakangas)

      Fix a case where the location of a page downlink was incorrectly
      tracked, and introduce some logic to allow recovering from such
      situations rather than silently doing the wrong thing.  This error
      could result in incorrect answers from subsequent index searches.
      It may be advisable to reindex all GiST indexes after installing
      this update.

    + Prevent de-duplication of btree index entries for interval columns
      (Noah Misch)

      There are interval values that are distinguishable but compare
      equal, for example "24:00:00" and "1 day".  This breaks assumptions
      made by btree de-duplication, so interval columns need to be excluded
      from de-duplication.  This oversight can cause incorrect results from
      index-only scans.  Moreover, after updating amcheck will report an
      error for almost all such indexes.  Users should reindex any btree
      indexes on interval columns.

    + Process date values more sanely in BRIN datetime_minmax_multi_ops
      indexes (Tomas Vondra)

      The distance calculation for dates was backward, causing poor
      decisions about which entries to merge.  The index still produces
      correct results, but is much less efficient than it should be.
      Reindexing BRIN minmax_multi indexes on date columns is advisable.

    + Process large timestamp and timestamptz values more sanely in BRIN
      datetime_minmax_multi_ops indexes (Tomas Vondra)

      Infinities were mistakenly treated as having distance zero rather
      than a large distance from other values, causing poor decisions about
      which entries to merge.  Also, finite-but-very-large values (near the
      endpoints of the representable timestamp range) could result in
      internal overflows, again causing poor decisions.  The index still
      produces correct results, but is much less efficient than it should
      be.  Reindexing BRIN minmax_multi indexes on timestamp and timestamptz
      columns is advisable if the column contains, or has contained,
      infinities or large finite values.

  * d/p/libpgport-pkglibdir: Adjust patch to reflect upstream changes.

  * d/p/50-per-version-dirs.patch: Adjust TestLib.pm's
    scan_server_header to account for unrelocatability of
    pg_config.
    This change replicates what is already being done in the
    check_pg_config function.  They are needed because, during build time,
    we want to be able to run the upstream tests using the pg_config
    binary from inside the "debian/" directory, but that doesn't work out
    of the box because it will print includedir paths that also point to
    "debian/", instead of to "/usr/include".  Therefore, we need to catch
    this specific scenario and print the proper includedir paths instead.

postgresql-14 (14.9-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy-security; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (LP: #2028426).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

    + However, if you use BRIN indexes, it may be advisable to reindex them.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.4, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Disallow substituting a schema or owner name into an extension script
      if the name contains a quote, backslash, or dollar sign (Noah Misch)

      This restriction guards against SQL-injection hazards for trusted
      extensions.
      (CVE-2023-39417)

    + Fix confusion between empty (no rows) ranges and all-NULL ranges in
      BRIN indexes, as well as incorrect merging of all-NULL summaries
      (Tomas Vondra)

      Each of these oversights could result in forgetting that a BRIN
      index range contains any NULL values, potentially allowing
      subsequent queries that should return NULL values to miss doing so.

      This fix will not in itself correct faulty BRIN entries.
      It's recommended to REINDEX any BRIN indexes that
      may be used to search for nulls.

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.4, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Prevent CREATE SCHEMA from defeating changes in search_path
      (Alexander Lakhin)

      Within a CREATE SCHEMA command, objects in the prevailing
      search_path, as well as those in the newly-created schema, would be
      visible even within a called function or script that attempted to set
      a secure search_path. This could allow any user having permission to
      create a schema to hijack the privileges of a security definer
      function or extension script.
      (CVE-2023-2454)

    + Enforce row-level security policies correctly after inlining a
      set-returning function (Stephen Frost, Tom Lane)

      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling
      query, those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some
      cases involving re-using a cached plan under a different role. This
      could allow a user to see or modify rows that should have been
      invisible.

postgresql-14 (14.4-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (LP: #1978249).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

    + However, if you have any indexes that were created using the
      CONCURRENTLY option under 14.X, you should re-index them after
      updating.  See the upstream changelog linked below for further
      information.

    + Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.3, see
      those release notes as well please.

    + Prevent possible corruption of indexes created or rebuilt with the
      CONCURRENTLY option (Álvaro Herrera).

      An optimization added in v14 caused CREATE INDEX ... CONCURRENTLY
      and REINDEX ... CONCURRENTLY to sometimes miss indexing rows that were
      updated during the index build. Revert that optimization. It is
      recommended that any indexes made with the CONCURRENTLY option be
      rebuilt after installing this update. (Alternatively, rebuild them
      without CONCURRENTLY.)

postgresql-14 (14.3-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy-security; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (LP: #1973627).

    + A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

    + However, if you have any GiST indexes on columns of type ltree (supplied
      by the contrib/ltree extension), you should re-index them after updating.
      See the upstream changelog linked below for further information.

    + Confine additional operations within "security restricted operation"
      sandboxes (Sergey Shinderuk, Noah Misch).

      Autovacuum, CLUSTER, CREATE INDEX, REINDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW,
      and pg_amcheck activated the "security restricted operation" protection
      mechanism too late, or even not at all in some code paths. A user having
      permission to create non-temporary objects within a database could
      define an object that would execute arbitrary SQL code with superuser
      permissions the next time that autovacuum processed the object, or that
      some superuser ran one of the affected commands against it.

      problem.

    + Make the server and libpq reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)

      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.

      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server, although
      that would only work if the server did not demand any authentication
      data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate authentication
      might well not do so.) (CVE-2021-23214)

      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the client's
      first few queries, although other details of libpq's behavior make that
      harder than it sounds.  A different line of attack is to exfiltrate the
      client's password, or other sensitive data that might be sent early in
      the session.  That has been shown to be possible with a server
      vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214. (CVE-2021-23222)

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jacob Champion for reporting these
      problems.
