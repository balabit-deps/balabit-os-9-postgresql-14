postgresql-14 (14.18-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy; urgency=medium

  A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

  However, if you have any self-referential foreign key constraints on
  partitioned tables, it may be necessary to recreate those constraints to
  ensure that they are being enforced correctly. Follow the steps below to
  do so.

  Also, if you have any BRIN bloom indexes, it may be advisable to reindex
  them after updating. Follow the steps below to do so.

  Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.14, see those
  release notes as well please.

  Avoid one-byte buffer overread when examining invalidly-encoded strings
  that are claimed to be in GB18030 encoding (Noah Misch, Andres Freund)

  While unlikely, a SIGSEGV crash could occur if an incomplete multibyte
  character appeared at the end of memory. This was possible both in the
  server and in libpq-using applications. (CVE-2025-4207)

  Handle self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables correctly
  (√Ålvaro Herrera)

  Creating or attaching partitions failed to make the required catalog
  entries for a foreign-key constraint, if the table referenced by the
  constraint was the same partitioned table. This resulted in failure to
  enforce the constraint fully.

  To fix this, you should drop and recreate any self-referential foreign
  keys on partitioned tables, if partitions have been created or attached
  since the constraint was created. Bear in mind that violating rows might
  already be present, in which case recreating the constraint will fail,
  and you'll need to fix up those rows before trying again.

  Avoid data loss when merging compressed BRIN summaries in
  brin_bloom_union() (Tomas Vondra)

  The code failed to account for decompression results not being identical
  to the input objects, which would result in failure to add some of the
  data to the merged summary, leading to missed rows in index searches.

  This mistake was present back to v14 where BRIN bloom indexes were
  introduced, but this code path was only rarely reached then. It's
  substantially more likely to be hit in v17 because parallel index builds
  now use the code.

postgresql-14 (14.17-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy; urgency=medium

  This release encompasses changes from upstream's 14.16 and 14.17
  releases.  The former contains fixes for CVE-2025-1094 (among other
  things), and the latter was a hotfix for a problem caused by the CVE
  fix from 14.16.

  A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

  Harden PQescapeString and allied functions against invalidly-encoded
  input strings (Andres Freund, Noah Misch)

  Data-quoting functions supplied by libpq now fully check the encoding
  validity of their input. If invalid characters are detected, they report
  an error if possible. For the ones that lack an error return convention,
  the output string is adjusted to ensure that the server will report
  invalid encoding and no intervening processing will be fooled by bytes
  that might happen to match single quote, backslash, etc.

  The purpose of this change is to guard against SQL-injection attacks
  that are possible if one of these functions is used to quote crafted
  input. There is no hazard when the resulting string is sent directly to
  a PostgreSQL server (which would check its encoding anyway), but there
  is a risk when it is passed through psql or other client-side code.
  Historically such code has not carefully vetted encoding, and in many
  cases it's not clear what it should do if it did detect such a problem.

  This fix is effective only if the data-quoting function, the server, and
  any intermediate processing agree on the character encoding that's being
  used. Applications that insert untrusted input into SQL commands should
  take special care to ensure that that's true.

  Applications and drivers that quote untrusted input without using these
  libpq functions may be at risk of similar problems. They should first
  confirm the data is valid in the encoding expected by the server.

  The PostgreSQL Project thanks Stephen Fewer for reporting this problem.
  (CVE-2025-1094)

  Improve behavior of libpq's quoting functions (Andres Freund, Tom Lane)

  The changes made for CVE-2025-1094 had one serious oversight:
  PQescapeLiteral() and PQescapeIdentifier() failed to honor their string
  length parameter, instead always reading to the input string's trailing
  null. This resulted in including unwanted text in the output, if the
  caller intended to truncate the string via the length parameter. With
  very bad luck it could cause a crash due to reading off the end of
  memory.

  In addition, modify all these quoting functions so that when invalid
  encoding is detected, an invalid sequence is substituted for just the
  first byte of the presumed character, not all of it. This reduces the
  risk of problems if a calling application performs additional processing
  on the quoted string.

postgresql-14 (14.15-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy; urgency=medium

  This release encompasses changes from upstream's 14.14 and 14.15
  releases.  The former contains fixes for 4 CVEs (among other
  things), and the latter was hotfix for a problem caused by one of
  the CVE fixes from 14.14.

  A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

  However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.12, see

  Ensure cached plans are marked as dependent on the calling role when
  RLS applies to a non-top-level table reference (Nathan Bossart)

  If a CTE, subquery, sublink, security invoker view, or coercion
  projection in a query references a table with row-level security
  policies, we neglected to mark the resulting plan as potentially
  dependent on which role is executing it.  This could lead to later query
  executions in the same session using the wrong plan, and then returning
  or hiding rows that should have been hidden or returned instead.

  The PostgreSQL Project thanks Wolfgang Walther for reporting this
  problem.
  (CVE-2024-10976)

  Make libpq discard error messages
  received during SSL or GSS protocol negotiation (Jacob Champion)

  An error message received before encryption negotiation is completed
  might have been injected by a man-in-the-middle, rather than being real
  server output.  Reporting it opens the door to various security hazards;
  for example, the message might spoof a query result that a careless user
  could mistake for correct output.  The best answer seems to be to
  discard such data and rely only on libpq's own report of the connection
  failure.

  The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jacob Champion for reporting this
  problem.
  (CVE-2024-10977)

  Fix unintended interactions between SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
  and SET ROLE (Tom Lane)

  The SQL standard mandates that SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION have a
  side-effect of doing SET ROLE NONE.  Our implementation of that was
  flawed, creating more interaction between the two settings than
  intended.  Notably, rolling back a transaction that had done SET SESSION
  AUTHORIZATION would revert ROLE to NONE even if that had not been the
  previous state, so that the effective user ID might now be different
  from what it had been before the transaction.  Transiently setting
  session_authorization in a function SET clause had a similar effect.  A
  related bug was that if a parallel worker inspected
  current_setting('role'), it saw none even when it should see something
  else.

  The PostgreSQL Project thanks Tom Lane for reporting this problem.
  (CVE-2024-10978)

  Prevent trusted PL/Perl code from changing environment variables
  (Andrew Dunstan, Noah Misch)

  The ability to manipulate process environment variables such as PATH
  gives an attacker opportunities to execute arbitrary code.  Therefore,
  trustedPLs must not offer the ability to do that.  To fix plperl,
  replace %ENV with a tied hash that rejects any modification attempt with
  a warning.  Untrusted plperlu retains the ability to change the
  environment.

  The PostgreSQL Project thanks Coby Abrams for reporting this problem.
  (CVE-2024-10979)

  Restore functionality of ALTER {ROLE|DATABASE} SET
  role (Tom Lane, Noah Misch)

  The fix for CVE-2024-10978 accidentally caused settings for role to
  not be applied if they come from non-interactive sources, including
  previous ALTER {ROLE|DATABASE} commands and the PGOPTIONS environment
  variable.

  Prevent unauthorized code execution during pg_dump (Masahiko Sawada)

  An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject
  SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent pg_dump session with the
  privileges of the role running pg_dump (which is often a superuser).
  The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a view
  or foreign table that will execute malicious code.  To prevent this,
  introduce a new server parameter restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind that
  can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign
  tables, and teach pg_dump to set it when available.  Note that the
  attack is prevented only if both pg_dump and the server it is dumping
  from are new enough to have this fix.

  The PostgreSQL Project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

postgresql-14 (14.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) jammy; urgency=medium

  A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.

  However, a security vulnerability was found in the system views
  pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs, potentially allowing
  authenticated database users to see data they shouldn't. If this is of
  concern in your installation, follow the steps below to rectify it.

  These views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve
  columns the accessing user does not have permission to read. View
  columns such as most_common_vals might expose security-relevant
  data. The potential interactions here are not fully clear, so in the
  interest of erring on the side of safety, make rows in these views
  visible only to the owner of the associated table.

  By itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
  database clusters. If you wish to apply this change in an existing
  cluster, you will need to do the following:

    - In each database of the cluster, run the
      /usr/share/postgresql/14/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql script as superuser. In
      psql this would look like:

        \i /usr/share/postgresql/14/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql

      It will not hurt to run the script more than once.

    - Do not forget to include the template0 and template1 databases,
      or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create
      later. To fix template0, you'll need to temporarily make it accept
      connections. Do that with:

        ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;

      and then after fixing template0, undo it with:

        ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

  those release notes as well please.

  However, one bug was fixed that could have resulted in corruption of
  GIN indexes during concurrent updates.  If you suspect such
